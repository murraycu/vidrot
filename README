A Gtkmm/GStreamermm application to rotate videos.

== Dependencies:

Depending on Linux distribution, certain codecs may not be installed
automatically. For example, Ubuntu users should read
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1117283 for information on installing

If you build gst-plugins-* from source:

See gstreammermm's README about dependencies that you probably need for vidrot
too when building gst-plugins-base.

When building gst-plugins-ugly from source you'll need this installed,
at least on Debian/Ubuntu:
libmp3lame-dev.

When building gst-plugins-bad from source you'll need these installed,
at least on Debian/Ubuntu:
libmp3lame-dev, libmjpegtools-dev.
